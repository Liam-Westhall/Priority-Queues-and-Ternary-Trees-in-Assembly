# Priority-Queues-and-Ternary-Trees-in-Assembly
Made with MARS simulator using the MIPS 32-bit assembly language, implemented functions to allocate memory for a priority queue built as a ternary tree data structure for a restaurant admitting various customers


Functions written in Proj4.asm, to run a function use the "function_name.asm" file and for ease, arguments are located in the args file
Just place those arguments in the .data section of the "function_name.asm" you are attemping to use
